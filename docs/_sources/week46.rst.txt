Week 46 - Introduction to AI
============================
Today and the next 3 weeks, we will work within the topic of "AI, Data Science and Machine Learning". 

We start out using the helicopter view and look at what AI are, and what Machine learning and Data Science´s role is in connection with this. 

The next weeks we will work in more details with Machine Learning and Data Science 
since this is in reality where the coding and algorithmic thinking is going on.
