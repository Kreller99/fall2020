Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
------------------------------------


Supervised Learning
        In supervised learning we learn from labeled data.
        Supervised learning is a very powerful learning method, but it can be very costly to create labeled data sets.

Unsupervised Learning 
        In unsupervised learning we don't have labeled data, so we must learn about data points based on their relation to other data points.
        Unsupervised learning is open for a wider range of problems than supervised learning, but the insights we can gain are less powerfull.
